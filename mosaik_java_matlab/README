This is a collection of information, examples and files to help connecting simulators in java (not bad) and matlab (which i hate) to mosaik.

The matlab high API functionalities were taken from here: https://github.com/hesstobi/matlab-mosaik-toolbox
Unfortunately this build is today (june 2019) 3 years old. Matlab and Mosaik have changed a lot in this period so i was expecting some 
problems.
This build relies on a library called JSONlab, which can transform data in JSON and vice versa.
